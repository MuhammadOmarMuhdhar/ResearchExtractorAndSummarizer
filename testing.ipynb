In this manuscript, we review a range of\\napplications of antifragility theory in technical systems (e.g., traffic\\ncontrol, robotics) and natural systems (e.g., cancer therapy, antibiotics).\\nWhile there is a broad overlap in methods used to quantify and apply\\nantifragility across disciplines, there is a need for precisely defining the\\nscales at which antifragility operates. Thus, we provide a brief general\\nintroduction to the properties of antifragility in applied systems and review\\nrelevant literature for both natural and technical systems' antifragility. We\\nframe this review within three scales common to technical systems: intrinsic\\n(input-output nonlinearity), inherited (extrinsic environmental signals), and\\ninterventional (feedback control), with associated counterparts in biological\\nsystems: ecological (homogeneous systems), evolutionary (heterogeneous\\nsystems), and interventional (control). We use the common noun in designing\\nsystems that exhibit antifragile behavior across scales and guide the reader\\nalong the spectrum of\\nfragility-adaptiveness-resilience-robustness-antifragility, the principles\\nbehind it, and its practical implications.\"}\n {'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14489v1', 'title': 'On the exclusion of exponential autocatalysts by sub-exponential autocatalysts', 'published_date': datetime.date(2023, 12, 22), 'authors': 'Yann Sakref, Olivier Rivoire', 'category': 'q-bio.PE', 'abstract': 'Selection among autocatalytic species fundamentally depends on their growth\\nlaw: exponential species, whose number of copies grows exponentially, are\\nmutually exclusive, while sub-exponential ones, whose number of copies grows\\npolynomially, can coexist.

The urgent demand for insight at the\\noutset of the pandemic meant early models were typically either simple or\\nrepurposed from existing research agendas. Our group predominantly uses\\nagent-based models (ABMs) to study fine-scale intervention scenarios. These\\nhigh-resolution models are large, complex, require extensive empirical data,\\nand are often more detailed than strictly necessary for answering qualitative\\nquestions like \"Should we lockdown?\" During the early stages of an\\nextraordinary infectious disease crisis, particularly before clear empirical\\nevidence is available, simpler models are more appropriate. As more detailed\\nempirical evidence becomes available, however, and policy decisions become more\\nnuanced and complex, fine-scale approaches like ours become more useful.\\n  In this manuscript, we discuss how our group navigated this transition as we\\nmodeled the pandemic. The role of modelers often included nearly real-time\\nanalysis, and the massive undertaking of adapting our tools quickly. We were\\noften playing catch up with a firehose of evidence, while simultaneously\\nstruggling to do both academic research and real-time decision support, under\\nconditions conducive to neither. By reflecting on our experiences of responding\\nto the pandemic and what we learned from these challenges, we can better\\nprepare for future demands.'}\n {'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11031v2', 'title': 'Chaotic turnover of rare and abundant species in a strongly interacting model community', 'published_date': datetime.date(2023, 6, 19), 'authors': 'Emil Mallmin, Arne Traulsen, Silvia De Monte', 'category': 'q-bio.PE', 'abstract': \"The composition of ecological communities varies not only between different\\nlocations but also in time.

This study aims to\\nevaluate the existence and possible outcomes of a more equitable global vaccine\\ndistribution and explore a concrete incentive mechanism that promotes vaccine\\nequity. Methods: We design a metapopulation epidemiological model that\\nsimultaneously considers global vaccine distribution and human mobility, which\\nis then calibrated by the number of infections and real-world vaccination\\nrecords during COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to July 2021. We explore the\\npossibility of the enlightened self-interest incentive mechanism, i.e.,\\nimproving one's own epidemic outcomes by sharing vaccines with other countries,\\nby evaluating the number of infections and deaths under various vaccine sharing\\nstrategies using the proposed model. To understand how these strategies affect\\nthe national interests, we distinguish the imported and local cases for further\\ncost-benefit analyses that rationalize the enlightened self-interest incentive\\nmechanism behind vaccine sharing. ...\"}\n {'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09175v1', 'title': 'Shedding light on social learning', 'published_date': datetime.date(2023, 10, 13), 'authors': 'Kingsley J.

In this paper, we study the ideal of phylogenetic invariants of the\\nCavender-Farris-Neyman (CFN) model on a phylogenetic network with the goal of\\nproviding a description of the invariants which is useful for network\\ninference. It was previously shown that to characterize the invariants of any\\nlevel-1 network, it suffices to understand all sunlet networks, which are those\\nconsisting of a single cycle with a leaf adjacent to each cycle vertex. We show\\nthat the parameterization of an affine open patch of the CFN sunlet model,\\nwhich intersects the probability simplex factors through the space of\\nskew-symmetric matrices via Pfaffians. We then show that this affine patch is\\nisomorphic to a determinantal variety and give an explicit Gr{\\\\\"o}bner basis\\nfor the associated ideal, which involves only polynomially many coordinates.\\nLastly, we show that sunlet networks with at least 6 leaves are identifiable\\nusing only these polynomials and run extensive simulations, which show that\\nthese polynomials can be used to accurately infer the correct network from DNA\\nsequence data.'}\n {'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09653v1', 'title': 'On inverse problems in predator-prey models', 'published_date': datetime.date(2023, 12, 15), 'authors': 'Yuhan Li, Hongyu Liu, Catharine W.

Furthermore, in parameter regions where a higher-contributing\\ncooperator cannot normally survive alone, the exploitation of lower value\\ncontribution cooperators allows their survival, resembling a parasitic\\nbehavior.

Using an empirically\\ncalibrated model, we show that MPB's distinctive life-history characteristics\\nare responsible for its distinctive population dynamics. Specifically, three\\nlife-history traits are necessary for episodic boom-bust dynamics:\\ndensity-dependent dispersal, where beetles disperse once most of the large\\ntrees have been killed; an Allee effect, which requires a threshold number of\\nbeetles to overcome tree defenses; and a short generation time, notably in\\ncomparison with their pine tree hosts.

In particular, precise estimation of\\nfeeding rates in consumer-resource dynamics is crucial, because\\nconsumer-resource processes are central in determining biomass transport across\\necosystems.

To shed light on how behavioral norms can resolve\\nthe social dilemma of cooperation, here we present a formal mathematical model\\nof individuals' decision making under general social norms, encompassing a\\nvariety of concerns and motivations an individual may have beyond simply\\nmaximizing their own payoffs. Using the canonical game of the Prisoner's\\nDilemma, we compare four different norms: compassion, universalizability,\\nreciprocity, and equity, to determine which social forces can facilitate the\\nevolution of cooperation, if any. We analyze our model through a variety of\\nlimiting cases, including weak selection, low mutation, and large population\\nsizes. This is complemented by computer simulations of population dynamics via\\na Fisher process, which confirm our theoretical results. We find that the first\\ntwo norms lead to the emergence of cooperation in a wide range of games, but\\nthe latter two do not on their own. Due to its generality, our framework can be\\nused to investigate many more norms, as well as how norms themselves emerge and\\nevolve. Our work complements recent work on fair-minded learning dynamics and\\nprovides a useful bottom-up perspective into understanding the impact of\\ntop-down social norms on collective cooperative intelligence.\"}\n {'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15190v1', 'title': 'Limited data on infectious disease distribution exposes ambiguity in epidemic modeling choices', 'published_date': datetime.date(2024, 1, 26), 'authors': 'Laura Di Domenico, Eugenio Valdano, Vittoria Colizza', 'category': 'q-bio.PE', 'abstract': 'Traditional disease transmission models assume that the infectious period is\\nexponentially distributed with a recovery rate fixed in time and across\\nindividuals.
